# TimesTable Tutoring

TimesTable Tutoring is a website designed for parents in the south west of England, who want to get their child extra maths tuition up to a GCSE standard. It is useful to the children who are struggling to reach their aspired level of ability and aims to help them reach this potential and in most cases achieve the highest possible grade.

### Features Left to Implement

    - A feature to implement in the future would be client reviews. This would allow new user's to see how previous consumers found the service offered by the company.

## Testing

    - All links in the navigation bar work and take the user to the intended area of the page. Furthermore, the sign up button in the how it works section also takes the user to the sign up form.
    - The responsiveness of the site has been tested and it works at multiple screen widths.
    - The sign up form requires information to be entered in every field and requires a vaild email address in the email field.
    - All content is easily readable.
    - At the start of the project, no styling effects were occuring. This bug was remedied by fixing a spelling mistake in the css file path.
